Labtracker:

Synopsis:
    Labtracker is a tool used to track items. The goal is to track item status through
    their history and be able to draw statisitcs from the change.

    Currently, the only item being tracked are computers, however, the final goal is to be
    able to define the items that you want to track.

    In addition, an Issue Tracking application is tied to Labtracker. This application
    allows users to file issues with specific items, groups, or item types. Issues can
    then be assigned to a registered user to be resolved.
