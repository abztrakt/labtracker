Goals:

0.1 Rumble:
	- Functional issue tracker 
	- Machines are hard coded for now, the only inventory type that is 
		tracked. Others can be constructed manually without (much) internal
		code manipulation
	- Machines should be searchable through the issuetracker
	- Search queries can be saved or trac like reports should be creatable
	  for everybody or individual use.
	- InventoryType automated creation process is not ready yet at this
	  stage.
	- Views are not yet ready at this stage

0.2 Thundercracker:
	- Assited InventoryType creation process
		- should be through the administration interface
	- Mostly functional (e.g.: core components) for admin interface

0.3 Galvatron:
	- Working views
	- automated hit script creation
		

Goal for 1.0:
	- Fully functionally issue tracker (broken bin)
	- Working views that allow difference ways to view collected data
	- Assisted InventoryType creation
