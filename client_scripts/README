 Run
    c:\python26\python.exe setup.py build

 This will compile the python files into Windows executables (.exe)

 The contents of the 'build' folder will contain all necessary files.

 Copy the folder inside 'build' (renaming it if you'd like) onto client machines. Using group 
policy, accessed by typing 'mmc' (without quotes - you may need to add the "Group Policy Object
Editor" snap in by going to File > Add/Remove Snap-In) into the Windows run command, add the
tracker.exe to the logon and logoff scripts (User Configuration > Windows Settings > Scripts).
For parameters, pass in '-a login' for the logon script and '-a logout' for the logoff script.
