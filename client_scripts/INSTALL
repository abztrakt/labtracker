1. Move the dist/ folder to a desired location. The contents of the dist/ folder contains all necessary files.

2. Access the Microsoft Management Console via entering 'mmc' (without quotes) in the Windows command line interface. (Start -> Run -> cmd.exe)

3. In the Management Console, using group policy, add the Labtracker client to logon/logoff scripts. This is done via the following:
	A. Go to File->Add/Remove Snap-in
	B. Near the bottom of the window that comes up, select Add, then add Group Policy Object Editor under the new window. Click OK on the Add/Remove Snap-in window.
	C. There will now be an icon in the main MMC window that reads Local Computer Policy. Click on it, then Computer Configuration, then Windows Settings, then Scripts (Startup/Shutdown).
	D. In Startup, add tracker.exe from the dist/ folder, and use parameters '-a login' for login. In Shutdown, add tracker.exe from the dist/ folder, and use parameters '-a logout' for logoff.

1. In the Mac terminal, run the following command:
	sudo ./install_or_update_on_mac.sh

NOTE: The location of install_or_update_on_mac.sh depends on the location of the Labtracker client app folder.
